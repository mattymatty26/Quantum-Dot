# Quantum-Dot

Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor particles a few nanometres in size, having optical and electronic properties that differ from larger particles due to quantum mechanics. They are a central topic in nanotechnology.

### <u>Potential Applications</u>
<br>

Potential applications of quantum dots include single-electron transistors, solar cells, LEDs, lasers, single-photon sources, second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, cell biology research, microscopy, and medical imaging. Their small size allows for some QDs to be suspended in solution, which may lead to use in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less expensive and less time-consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.

### <u>Purpose of this analysis</u>
<br>

This notebook looks to analyse the theory that governs the Quantum Dot.
 Things covered include:
* The size of a QD and how features of the system can effect it
* The energy required to cause a transition between states
* The likihood to exhibit Quantum Tunnelling and in what states
* The effects of different potentials and how this can be used in nanotechnology
* The effects of spin on a QD
* A further analysis into bonding and anti-bonding states
* The impact of disturbances to the system
* The Detuning effect on QDs
